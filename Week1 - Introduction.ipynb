This Bootcamp is for people that would like to learn new skills and would like to learn the basics of the Python programming lanuguage. If you have never coded before in your life, or if you'd like to learn a new language, or people that know the basics of Python but would like to level up their Python skills, then this course is for you. The accompanying Jupyter notebooks will provide you with resources for you to explore further, as well as code snippets for you to practice with."

    "\"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\" [1](jupyter.org/). It supports over 40 programming languages including Python, R, Julia and Scala (these are very popular data science languages). Notebooks can easily be shared via GitHub, Jupyter Notebook Viewer, email and even Dropbox. The notebook can produce a variety of rich outputs (e.g. images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript) and can be used to manipulate and visualise data in real time [1](jupyter.org). Finally, Jupyter notebooks also allows integration into big data platforms such as Apache Spark and Scala.\n",
